mapping-genres-website
======================

This repository contains all the code necessary to run the website for the
*Mapping Colonial Americas Publishing Project* website at [http://cds.library.brown.edu/projects/mapping-genres/][1], including the [flask app][2], requirements.txt file, data files, and the [d3.js][3] data visualizations.  If you need help getting flask installed with a virtualenv, see [this tutorial][4].  

**IF YOU JUST WANT THE DATA** ignore this repository and go to [https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/mapping-genres-data][5], which will give you json and csv files as well as a set of documented munging scripts for  working with library data.

To view the d3js code directly, look in /templates/visualizations for the relevant html file.
